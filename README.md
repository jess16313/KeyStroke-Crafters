Welcome to KeyStroke Crafers! This game will challenges users to type as fast and as accurate as they can, and provide a leaderboard for all players. Users can also learn more about the data structures and algorithms used to create this program.

To start, open the project in a C++ IDE, such as CLion. From here, build the project and click the start button.

After the program begins running, users will be met with a Welcome screen that will ask if they have played before or not. This allows users to create a new player username and ID, or log in with a previous player username and ID. Usernames must only contain letters and IDs must be a 4 digit number. 

Users will then be presented with the game options. Users can begin the typing game by inputting 1 or 2 (depending on if they would like to use a Hash Table or BST for the typing game). By inputting 3, players have the option to see all of the ranked players in the player.txt file. By inputting 4, player will be able to learn more information about Hash Tables, BSTs, Merge Sort Algorithms, and Heap Sort Algorithms. Finally, if a user is done playing the game, they can input 5 to exit.

Once the typing game starts with either the Hash Table or BST, users will be reminded to turn the caps lock on, so that their is no unnecessary errors in typing. Users will then start by typing the first of 5 words they see and hit enter. If there is an error, the total error count will show. Once there is 3 errors, the game will be over. 

After the game is over, users will be informed if their player has reach a new personal best in typing speed or accuracy. Then, users will see what their typing speed and accuracy was for that game. Finally, users will also see how long the algorithm took to run, which allows for comparisions between the Hash Table and BST data structures.

Players will then be presented with the game options again, and will continue to be presented with the options until they choose to exit the program.
